Create a todo List

1) List out all the objective in DOM
2) Append a button to each objective
3) present = false
4) Call a function (updateDOM) where the DOM gets refreshed


updateDOM() {

    if(present == true){
        Do step 1 and 2
        if step 4 happens (when the button[DONE] gets clicked) and call updateDOM
    }
}


func () {
    when button gets clicked array is appended and updateDOM is called with present value of the 
    current objective as true
}
